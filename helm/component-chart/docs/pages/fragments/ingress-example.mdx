To automatically create an ingress for a component, you can configure the `ingress` section for the component:
```yaml {6-11}
containers:
- name: frontend
  image: mendhak/http-https-echo
service:
  ports:
  - port: 8080
ingress:
  tls: true
  rules:
  - host: my-static-host.tld
  - host: other-domain.tld
    path: /login
```

:::warning
You need to define a `service` with at least one `port` to be able to use the `ingress` option (see example above).
